# CLI-Implementing-Linux-Commands-in-Java

In comparison to other operating systems such as Windows. Linux has a sophisticated command-line interface. Certain linux commands with pipe were developed here using java applications that mimic the operation of some fundamental linux commands.

## Installation

This project requires JDK 11 or above version and does not need any external jar files to run the CLI commands.

```bash
 javac filename.java
 java filename linux_Command
```
    
## Features
This program simulates the working of command line interface in Linux-like environment. The following linux command operations have been implemented:

- [Cat Command](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/cat-writing-file#:~:text=The%20cat%20command%20is%20a,some%20texts%20into%20a%20file.): The programs reads data from the input file and displays the data in the CLI.
- [Ls](): The Command list all the dir/files in the specified input directory.
- [Wc Command](): It returns the number of words, letters, and lines in the input file.
- [Head/Tail Command](): The commands return the specified number of lines from the top (head) and bottom (Tail) lines of the provided input file.
- [Sort Command](): The command sort the file's content.
- [Pipe Command](): It mimic the pipe command feature, allowing the use of many commands at the same time.


## Testing

 [JUnit]() testing for converter and pipe.

 JUnit testing for converter and pipe.

 JUnit 5 = junit jupiter + junit platform + junit vintage


***Some additional jar files were required for testing***.

All these library combined with will form a JUnit environment and to run Junit testing without using maven or gradle.

```bash
 javac test_filename.java
 java test_filename
```
