# AzugaTraining-Codeops

The Azuga Training Project entails the development of well-modularized Java code that provides various functionalities. These codes are written as part of CodeOps training as day-to-day tasks and are uploaded to the Github repository so that they can be used for future references and will be available for any updates and suggestions from the people for project upgradation.

## Features
The Project Azuga Training comprises codes for several applications like,

- [Linux Commands](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) The project includes programs that mimic some of the essential Linux commands such as cat, wc, head, tail, sort, ls, and so on.
- [Api Calls](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) It is included with programs for major Api's GET methods to get the data from the Api's and use them to create the .csv and .json files.
- [File Formatting](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) The data from the api's call method, which is saved in .csv and.json files, is formatted to .xml, .pdf, and.html.
- [charts creation](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) The api data in the files is used to generate the charts, which are graphical representations of the Api data's features such as a bar chart, pie chart, and line chart.
- [OOPs Concepts](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) Interface, methods, objects, classes, constructors, abstraction and encapsulation were all used in the java code.
- [Zip and Unzip](https://github.com/PruthviKumarP/AzugaTraining.git) The reports generated by api's data and Formatters were zipped, unzipped, and sent via email programmatically using Java.
## Run Locally
